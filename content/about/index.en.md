Julie carefully employs the hundred- year-old material, neon, as if she were sculpting wire, paying attention to avoid the false certainties of the over-defined and over-focused advertising sign. Her work has a fragile and musical balance: Quoting Lacan, Julie feels that truth can only be found in the “middle-ground”. We cover one eye to see better from the other.

The neon light invites us to an open form of obscurity. The lines of each sculpture heading towards their own abolition. Julie’s sculptures in neon are voluntarily harmless, a mocking response to the powers that hold the light in such high esteem.

The aura of the neon suggests the rest of the sculpture. A ballet composed of unbalanced creatures, hiding in light and shadows. Silhouettes composed from a range of human possibilities, sometimes crying, sometimes dancing.
It is in the dialectic between the glow of the artificial neon and the imperfections of the human body that lays the voice of the artist.

Julie lives and works in Paris.
