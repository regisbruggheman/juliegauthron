Dior commissioned Julie to create an exclusive wrought iron sculpture for their new Chicago flagship. The piece entitled ‘La Muse de Tim’, located on the first floor of the store, reflects the timeless elegance and innovation of the Parisian fashion house. The new Chicago boutique, located at 931 N. Rush Street, is a modern concept inspired by Dior’s traditional flagship on Avenue Montaigne in Paris.
