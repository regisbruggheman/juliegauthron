This installation, custom-made for the Hotel Renaissance République in Paris, is a representation of our city. In homage to the cult film Hôtel du Nord by Marcel Cerné, I selected the iconic and cheeky French kiss’, fantasised by Americans. This ‘French Kiss’ in coloured neon, 2m high by 2m50, is an ode to sexual liberty, with the added ambiguity of the sex of the models.
