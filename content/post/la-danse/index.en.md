To draw movement is to dance with oneâ€™s hand, continuing the sensation of the rhythm. The beauty of movement, a yearning to express movement in the form of a simple line.

By representing in one image several stages of
a dance, the drawing comes alive. This creates incoherances, superposing confusion of what one perceives of the body. This approach requires letting go completely, so that the hand can follow the rhythm, mixing together the fragments caught by the eye.
