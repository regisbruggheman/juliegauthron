Theatre of passion and emotion.
Putting on stage emotions on stripped naked. Twisted spirits, desperation, craziness - emotions that both scare and attract us.
The fascination for emotions that overwhelm, or the energy of a tortured soul.
The naked body is the flaying that exacerbates interior conflicts. The twisted body expressing the suffering inside.
