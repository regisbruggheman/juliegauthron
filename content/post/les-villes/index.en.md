The city as a sketch by mankind, like an open history book. Its structures, levels and volumes are its identity. The rhythm of the sketch must represent its tension, its energy flows.
A composition of the cityâ€™s limits, small and large. An accumulation of small volumes.
Structuring a place of life.
