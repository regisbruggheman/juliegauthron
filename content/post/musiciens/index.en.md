Musical inspiration. Figurative music.
Jazz with connotations of Brazil, Cuba, Lebanon, American soul... the voice of an English rose, a sexy violin player from New York, Boston, Sydney or Paris... Concerts in small intimate and often crowded rooms.
The smoky atmosphere of jazz and rock, with a proximity to the musicians. They see that I am drawing them, complicity sets in.
The action of drawing takes a rhythm, a partition fused with the musiciansâ€™ portrait, the instruments, the singers...
