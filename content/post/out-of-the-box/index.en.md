For this study, a three-dimensional self-portrait,
I focus on a personality trait - my desire to always deviate from the norm, to think independently and to not confine myself to preconceived ideas. This notion of stepping away from the familiar, of refusing taboos, keeps me free and encourages me to try anything, without looking to be provocative. I believe this is the framework to the theatre of life. One must desire to leave it behind to be free, but one can never leave it behind totally. It’s the struggle that counts.

Here, I try to leave behind the framework, the box that contains us. Like the English expression, to think outside the box. With reference to the dramatising and preoccupation of the self, ever- present in today’s contemporary art.
