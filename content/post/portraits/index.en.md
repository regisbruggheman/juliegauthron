For Julie, portrait drawing is an exercise that
one must practise regularly. Like life drawing
with nude models, it demands an empathy with the subject, a desire to understand. It requires a meeting face-to-face, both parties must let go in order to leave behind the rules and conventions that dictate our superficial interactions.
To unveil, to reveal, what we perceive of the other. It is an art that is often judged by mere visual recognition. However the challenge is in the reflection of the personality we behold, to bear all its contradictions and frailties.
